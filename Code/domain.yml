  - text: "when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>"
  - text: "And felt that feeling of safety"
  - text: "if you watch the news, your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it"

  - text: "I don't subscribe to cable"
  - text: "so I guess, that's an alternative  "
  - text: "we ski"
  - text: "and I'm enjoying it.  "
  - text: "as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion, which I would  be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's"
  - text: "My sisters both seem to like it pretty well"
  - text: "but adequate ones were really tough to find"
  - text: "but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home "

  - text: "she got older "
  - text: "now that I'm older, of course, it's different "
  - text: "but, I don't know, I think if you listen to like NPR or something like"
  - text: "I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers"
  - text: "and then when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside"
  - text: "I just have to be honest about it  "
  - text: "I have wonderful friends  "
  - text: "and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news"
  - text: "But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work "
  - text: "it's funny"
  - text: "but I guess it's still a lot of hype"
  - text: "they had done such a good job "
  - text: "and this is his first year"

  - text: "I think about, wouldn't it be nice, "

  - text: "she said, we never do those things anyway "
  - text: "I'm a news junkie"
  - text: "overall, the quality of the news you get of most sources I would say is pretty low. "
  - text: "so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads"
  - text: "usually you get pretty incomplete coverage "
  - text: "I really like them because they give, instead of being, as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which i think is good"
  - text: "It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, "
  - text: "my best friend is one child of ten  "
  - text: "I've only been to Texas once"
  - text: "and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight"
  - text: "I've actually read the actual articles"
  - text: "she was paid very well because the parents trusted them"
  - text: "one of the ways that I get information is, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing"
  - text: "It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally "
  - text: "you have to chase them down constantly "
  - text: "When you see all these horror stories on television about child care  "
  - text: "but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while"
  - text: "I would probably be a junkie or watch <laughter> CNN a lot"
  - text: "I'm around my kids  "
  - text: "it's just frightening "
  - text: "so  I've never been around children  "
  - text: "that worked for a while,  "
  - text: " it's great, "
  - text: "I had never been there"
  - text: "So I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned "
  - text: "I am a travel agent at heart"
  - text: "you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, - "
  - text: "And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,"
  - text: "they're on the rainy side"
  - text: "we are on the dry side of the mountains"
  - text: "so, it's such a responsibility "
  - text: "having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children"
  - text: "I guess that's true"
  - text: " I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas"
  - text: "it's the one that's going downhill,"
  - text: "For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, a couple of newspapers"
  - text: "I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children "
  - text: "it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way"
  - text: "Neil and Lehrer, they're pretty good too"
  - text: "they basically, type out abstracts which are really literally, -"
  - text: "They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school"
  - text: "that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible, "
  - text: "she and her roommate became live-in care givers  "
  - text: "And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us"
  - text: "It's just the way your attitude changes "
  - text: "and I ski"
  - text: "Seattle is only about two and a half hours"
  - text: " but, you know,  they need the money  "
  - text: "so that worked out pretty well  "
  - text: "we snow ski"
  - text: "I think that sort of goes hand in hand "
  - text: "I love traveling and being involved in that and finding out more"
  - text: "but then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good."
  - text: "I'm living in a dream world, "
  - text: "So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that "
  - text: " somewhere  on one afternoon  "
  - text: "She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,  "
  - text: "it's just such a responsibility"
  - text: "actually, I'm not even sure"
  - text: "you mature I suppose "
  - text: "because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope,"
  - text: "I mean one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where"
  - text: "I miss NPR a lot also"
  - text: "it's low hills"
  - text: "I've skied in Colorado"
  - text: "and I guess that's good when it's live, if you'll really want that"
  - text: "taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,  "
  - text: "they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child "
  - text: "Me, too"
  - text: "I'm an only child "
  - text: "of course there's still a lot of work to be done,  "

  - text: "escape"
  - text: "But it's beautiful"
  - text: "because of the poor service and also because I give to the United Way"
  - text: "but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband"
  - text: "but it's mostly oaks"
  - text: "and we're on the colder side,"
  - text: "As I said, I don't have kids  "
  - text: "I don't know,"
  - text: "they loved it"
  - text: "and I enter things in our little state fair,"
  - text: "They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends"
  - text: "I guess one of them is leaving."
  - text: "It must be interesting  "
  - text: "because my fiance - she was unemployed for a while "
  - text: "where obviously she"
  - text: "they say it's  like the sixth grade reading level"
  - text: "that's bad to have to admit, too, "
  - text: "Now we have one takes piano lessons"
  - text: "But they seem to like it okay."
  - text: "we were lucky when our children were that age, "
  - text: "I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories  "
  - text: "I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other "
  - text: "If you could just, have a whole bunch <laughter>"
  - text: "but when you have them in, their little feet are moving "
  - text: "I had some visitor, he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, just listened to it constantly"
  - text: "course I've been working on it for five years"
  - text: "it's really different because  that's the chalk hills down there,"
