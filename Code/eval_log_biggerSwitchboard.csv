that's, that's what I was, uh,	sd	uninterpretable	-8	-8	-6
I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, uh, overstated. That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.	sd	uninterpretable	-47	-47	-45

Uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult.	sv	qo	-13	-12	-11

you I think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, where, uh, or, uh, uh, A A R P, which has a lot of members. Uh, if you can get those types of groups.	sv	q	-51	-49	-49

Uh-huh.	b	ny	0	0	2
Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.	qy	qy	-3	-1	-1
I mean, I remember reading an article that said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,	sd	h	-3	7	7
the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent, of the automobile pollution	sd	fo_o_fw_\"_by_bc	-20	-19	-18

and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything.	sv	sv	-5	-1	-1

they're better,	sv	q	-1	0	1

Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh,	qw	t1	-18	-17	-16

but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.	qy	qh	-3	-3	-1

fuel is, is one of their biggest costs.	sd	ny	-1	-1	1

But diesel engines.	uninterpretable	sv	-1	5	5

diesel engines.	sd	bf	0	0	2
It, you know, it's, it,	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	-7	-7	-5
I mean, they do generate a lot of soot	sv	uninterpretable	-8	-8	-6

We could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid transit systems.	sd	na	-12	-12	-10
This country seems to be a little behind on that.	sv	h	-1	-1	1
Yeah.	b	nlu_fallback	0	1	2
On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient.	sv	h	-9	-7	-7
Um, yeah,	b	ny	-1	-1	1
but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car, driving.	sv	h	-8	-1	-1

Uh-huh.	b	ny	-1	-1	1
The, uh, United States and Canada are I guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements to limit, uh, what's being given out by power plants,	sd	b	-35	-34	-33
Uh-huh.	b	ny	-1	-1	1
I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,	sd	qy	-1	-1	1
Yeah,	b	b	0	1	2
sure.	b	q	0	2	2
So that's helping.	sv	fo_o_fw_\"_by_bc	-2	-1	0
Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe	qw	qw	-15	-15	-13
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted?	fo_o_fw_"_by_bc	q	-2	3	3
Now that's an idea.	ba	h	-1	-1	1
don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,	ad	qy	-22	-21	-20
Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax	sd	ad	-14	-13	-12
or you just buy one of these things	sd	qrr	-3	-3	-1
and it, it, uh,	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	-2	-1	0
maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	sv	h	-14	-14	-12
and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts	sd	uninterpretable	-10	-10	-8
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe	sd	q	-9	-8	-7
and you couldn't start your car anymore.	sd	nlu_fallback	-1	-1	1
That's a, that's an interesting concept.	ba	aa	-5	-5	-3
Is that your idea?	qy	nlu_fallback	-3	-2	-1
Yeah,	ny	ny	0	5	5
but, uh, you know, it's, uh,	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	-11	-10	-9
I guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again	sv	h	-4	3	3
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something.	sv	h	-4	-3	-2
Well I was going to say,	sd	fc	0	4	4
right.	aa	nlu_fallback	0	21	21
You could put it in, you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter.	sd	h	-2	-1	0
Right.	b	na	0	0	2
I mean I guess you could take those off too	sv	h	-9	-9	-7
but,	uninterpretable	sv	-1	7	7
You could take	uninterpretable	ad	-1	1	1
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.	sv	t3	-12	-12	-10
Yeah,	aa	qh	0	12	12
if you can take a muffler off and only replace,	sd	ad	-4	-2	-2
well not unless it was built into every muffler.	sd	h	-3	-1	-1
Right.	b	na	0	0	2
And that's .	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	-2	-2	0
But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,	sd	qo	-37	-36	-35
That's a, that's quite a concept.	ba	aa	-5	-5	-3
You should, uh, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.	sv	ad	-13	-13	-11
Yeah,	aa	ba	0	8	8
patent it,	sd	ad	0	4	4
that's a good idea.	sv	uninterpretable	-4	-4	-2
If you could come up with a device that's the thing.	sv	bf	0	0	2
Right.	b	b	0	1	2
But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that.	sv	h	-9	-8	-7

No,	uninterpretable	aa	0	3	3
Uh-huh.	b	ny	-1	-1	1
you're right	sv	aa	0	0	2

I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help	sv	uninterpretable	-22	-22	-20

Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of,	sd	h	-29	-29	-27
you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts	sv	sv	-10	-8	-8

but these days they're not, uh,	sv	uninterpretable	-6	-5	-4
parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.	sv	bf	-10	-8	-8
Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part of, of the scouting, and, you know.	sd	br	-31	-31	-29

and then I do low impact aerobics.	sd	fc	-6	-5	-4
Okay.	bk	nlu_fallback	0	0	2
I guess you don't enjoy that very much.	qy^d	fc	-4	-3	-2
Not, not really.	ng	ng	-4	1	1
Do you find that, uh, to be boring?	qy	qy	-1	-1	1
Yeah,	ny	aap_am	0	2	2
and time consuming,	sd	q	-2	-2	0
I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,	sv	uninterpretable	-12	-10	-10
it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,	sv	sv	-11	-9	-9
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.	sv	fo_o_fw_\"_by_bc	-8	-8	-6
Yeah.	b	nlu_fallback	0	0	2
Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.	sd	h	-3	-3	-1
Oh, yeah.	b	bh	-2	-1	0
But I,	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	-1	-1	1
Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year	qy	qy	-12	-10	-10
Yeah,	ny	qh	0	6	6
I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not	sd	ng	-10	-9	-8
I just bought myself a solo flex machine,	sd	h	-4	4	4
I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.	qy^d	qy^d	-5	-3	-3
Uh-huh.	ny	b	0	3	3
It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.	sd	na	-8	-8	-6
But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,	sd	uninterpretable	-11	-11	-9
so it's collecting dust right now.	sd	bf	-7	-5	-5
Yeah,	b	h	0	6	6
a lot of things do that.	sv	sv	0	0	2
I had an, I had an exercise bike	sd	ng	-3	-1	-1
I used to jog somewhat.	sd	h	-3	-2	-1
I use to have one,	sd	ba	-3	0	0
and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,	sd	ng	-1	1	1

Uh-huh,	b	b	0	10	10
well, that's good.	ba	ba	-1	-1	1
Yeah,	uninterpretable	aa	0	2	2
my parents have a treadmill	sd	sv	0	6	6
it's,	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	0	2	2
when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.	sd	q	-15	-13	-13
Yeah,	b	na	0	7	7
it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.	sv	sv	-13	-11	-11
Uh-huh,	b	aa	0	3	3
I just got the bicycle out today,	sd	na	0	2	2

had to get out to do something.	sd	sv	-2	-1	0
Yeah,	b	b	-1	2	2
I can't ride a bike	sd	qy	0	1	2
so.	uninterpretable	fc	0	18	18
I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold	sd	ng	-1	4	4

Oh.	b	h	0	0	2
Yeah,	b	aa	0	2	2
it's too nice,	sv	q	-3	-1	-1
it's been too nice all weekend.	sv	uninterpretable	-7	-7	-5
But, uh, yeah,	b	uninterpretable	-3	-3	-1
I need to start jog something again.	sv	na	-7	22	22
I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,	sv	q	-13	-12	-11
but it's terribly boring,	sv	sv	-1	-1	1
and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.	sd	uninterpretable	-11	-10	-9
Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?	qy	qy	-1	-1	1
No,	nn	ad	0	4	4
I never have.	sd	q	-2	2	2
Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries	sv	ng	-4	1	1
I usually only go about a mile or two.	sd	ng	0	1	2
I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.	sd	h	-30	-28	-28
Yeah,	b	b	0	2	2
it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.	sv	uninterpretable	-14	-14	-12
Uh-huh.	b	aa	0	7	7
Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.	sv	bf	-11	-10	-9
Yeah,	b	b	0	1	2
that's not quite so so easy.	sv	h	-5	-4	-3
You have to have the right, type of shoes too,	sv	qy^d	-1	-1	1
that's, very important.	sv	uninterpretable	-3	-3	-1
Yeah.	b	nlu_fallback	0	1	2
Yeah.	b	nlu_fallback	0	0	2
I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .	sd	aa	-8	-8	-6
But,	uninterpretable	qy^d	0	5	5
Yeah,	b	ny	0	1	2
I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often	sd	ng	-5	-3	-3
my don't get very much use	sd	ba	-6	-6	-4
Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.	sv	h	-14	-14	-12
Uh-huh.	b	ny	-1	-1	1
I usually enjoy the exercise I do	sd	fc	-4	-2	-2
but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.	sd	uninterpretable	-19	-19	-17
So I'll, I'll bicycle	sd	h	-4	-1	-1
I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,	sd	h	-25	-24	-23
but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.	sd	uninterpretable	-25	-25	-23
But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,	sd	uninterpretable	-11	-11	-9
Yeah.	b	nlu_fallback	0	0	2
I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,	sd	h	-15	-15	-13
I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.	sd	q	-14	-12	-12
Yeah,	b	b	0	1	2
well, don't let it collect dust.	ad	h	-8	-8	-6
At least exercise while dusting it off	ad	h	-1	-1	1
Yeah.	b	b	-1	2	2
well.	b	h	-1	-1	1
Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.	sd	h	-11	-11	-9
Yeah,	b	na	0	5	5
that, that'll be good.	ba	ba	-1	1	1
I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.	sd	h	-6	-5	-4
Uh-huh.	b	ny	0	0	2
Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,	sd	t1	-20	-18	-18
an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.	sd	uninterpretable	-25	-24	-23
Oh.	b	h	0	0	2
And that was very helpful	sd	ba	0	0	2
we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.	sd	bf	-27	-25	-25
Uh-huh.	b	ny	0	14	14
I found that to be, uh, very helpful.	sd	ba	-1	-1	1
Are you going to do that?	qy	qh	-1	-1	1
Uh, I need to,	no	h	-3	-3	-1
I haven't started yet	sd	h	0	9	9
but, uh, it's a thought.	sv	uninterpretable	-6	-6	-4
Well, that sounds like something good to do then.	sv	h	-10	-10	-8
Sounds like something I should do.	sv	h	0	0	2
Yeah,	b	no	0	4	4
nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.	sv	sv	0	4	4
How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?	qw	qw	-12	-11	-10

Okay.	bk	nlu_fallback	0	0	2
but I'm trying to workup to three miles.	sd	h	-8	-7	-6
Well, that's good.	ba	ba	-2	0	0
Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.	sv	h	-2	-1	0
Yeah,	b	ny	0	4	4
It,	uninterpretable	2	0	2	2
it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.	sv	q	-10	-9	-8
Sure.	b	aa	0	0	2
Yeah,	b	b	0	1	2
but.	uninterpretable	uninterpretable	0	0	2
Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,	sv	ad	-9	-9	-7
My walkman broke,	sd	q	-1	7	7

and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud	sd	oo_co_cc	-3	-3	-1

Well, I don't know.	h	h	-1	-1	1
I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening.	sd	h	-27	-26	-25
Uh, I'm against it	sd	h	-2	2	2
but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that	sd	nlu_fallback	-17	-17	-15
So I, I have a rifle in the house.	sd	uninterpretable	-7	-7	-5
Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it.	sd	na	-5	-2	-2
But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon.	sd	uninterpretable	-19	-19	-17
Uh, how do you feel about it?	qo	qo	0	6	6
Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.	sv	uninterpretable	-15	-15	-13
Huh.	uninterpretable	nlu_fallback	0	0	2
And, I think they need that.	sv	uninterpretable	-3	-3	-1
Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol.	sd	uninterpretable	-9	-9	-7
It's a little twenty-two	sd	qy^d	-3	-1	-1

Uh-huh.	b	ny	-1	-1	1
you know, I do like to have my guns.	sd	qy^d	-1	3	3
Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know.	sd	uninterpretable	-13	-11	-11
And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old	sd	h	-9	-7	-7
Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.	sd	na	-9	-7	-7
Uh-huh.	b	b	0	1	2
But, uh, I like to have them where handy.	sd	uninterpretable	-9	-9	-7
Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition.	sd	h	-23	-23	-21
And I thought that was really good.	sv	uninterpretable	-6	-6	-4
And I think if they, uh,	sv	uninterpretable	-1	-1	1
takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition.	sd	h	-30	-29	-28
You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.	sd	bh	-17	-16	-15
I've never heard of anything like that.	sd	ng	-1	-1	1
Yeah. Uh,	b	b	-1	-1	1
That would be nice.	sv	ba	0	1	2
But,  you know,	uninterpretable	ad	0	4	4
the criminals that are going to get their guns one  way or the other.	sv	2	-8	-6	-6
I  I, I agree.	aa	uninterpretable	-2	0	0
I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.	sv	na	-52	-51	-50
But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.	sv	ad	-6	-4	-4
Yeah	b	qh	0	0	2
And you can get them really cheap.	sv	2	-3	-2	-1
I know	aa	q	0	8	8
I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee. And, uh, they had a waiting period	sd	h	-16	-15	-14
Uh-huh.	b	ny	-1	0	1
and, uh, we bought it there.	sd	uninterpretable	-6	-6	-4

How long was the waiting period out there?	qw	qw	-4	-4	-2
About nine days.	sd	na	0	0	2

That wasn't too, too bad.	sv	h	-1	1	1
No.	aa	ar	0	0	2

Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it.	sv	2	-39	-38	-37
You're not going to react that quickly.	sv	q	-6	-5	-4
In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.	sv	bf	-24	-23	-22
somebody wants to do that,	sv	ad	-5	-5	-3
