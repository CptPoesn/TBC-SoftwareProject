Things kinda got messy uploading so perhaps you could just go to "here" and get all files I made changes of.
* Github didn't allow me to upload the newly trained models (.tar) cuz its larger than 25MB, so the models uploaded are older
* please ignore the "thing" files in each folder, i created them to be able to open the folders cuz im a noob lol
* just go to the "here" folder and take the files you need i'd suggest

Changes in files from init model:
1. nlu.yml
  - added new intents: "stalling" & "itsok"
  - be aware of "metadata" formatting different from usual examples ("text:" and indent)
2. stories.yml
  - added new story: "ok path"
3. domain.yml
  - added new intents in nlu to the list
  - added new response "utter_itsok"
  - be aware that all examples in responses require "text:"

Image - chat example with the updates:
- some learning is happening
- all user inputs are unseen/ not in the training examples
- "It's ok" and "Hey do you mean.." belong to the same response "itsok"
