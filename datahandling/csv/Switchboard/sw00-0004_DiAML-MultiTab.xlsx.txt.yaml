    I lived in Germany 
  - text: |
    and in Germany they don't have the jury system
  - text: |
    What they do is they have three judges basically
  - text: |
    And you get up there  
  - text: |
    and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence  
  - text: |
    your defense attorney presents their evidence  
  - text: |
    I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it
  - text: |
    when you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty
  - text: |
    we have a family called All day family
  - text: |
    All the people signed confessions
  - text: |
    they went to a trial by jury
  - text: |
    what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done
  - text: |
    I would have to look at it
  - text: |
    if they did it with just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
  - text: |
    because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures
  - text: |
    they know what's good and what isn't
  - text: |
    they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,  /
  - text: |
    you can't use this as evidence
  - text: |
    because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
  - text: |
    you wouldn't have this theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury
  - text: |
    and then the judge says no disregard that
  - text: |
    my favorite is the police department
  - text: |
    <breathing> they're not aimed at the criminal

    The judicial system is aimed at the citizens

    we have telephones

    then we have checkbooks
  - text: |
     Criminals have none of these things
  - text: |
    They're real difficult to catch
  - text: |
    and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas we write a check
  - text: |
    I've nailed the problem down  
  - text: |
    I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about
  - text: |
    I think to begin with you would have
  - text: |
    like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical
  - text: |
    talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases
  - text: |
    It's kind of like do it in the similar vein like VCR or television repair
  - text: |
    If you take your TV in a lot of these TV repair places will say  well  I'll repair your TV for a hundred dollars
  - text: |
    and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it
  - text: |
    he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars
  - text: |
    if he comes in and says  I'll repair your VCR or somebody else's VCR for a hundred dollars gets in there
  - text: |
    maybe it's a blown fuse
  - text: |
    takes him two minutes
  - text: |
    he fixes it
  - text: |
    he still charges you that hundred dollars
  - text: |
    maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case
  - text: |
    And here's this bum that didn't have a job
  - text: |
    it's amazing
  - text: |
    when you stop and look at it the judges they're all former lawyers
  - text: |
    that's another problem
  - text: |
    they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever
