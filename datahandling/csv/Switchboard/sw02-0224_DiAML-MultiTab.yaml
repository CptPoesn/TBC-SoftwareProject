  - text: |
    I think that may be the key word 
  - text: |
    so it's difficult for them
  - text: |
    our children are now eleven and nine 
  - text: |
    we moved away from institutionalized child care --
  - text: |
    at one point in time we've had au pairs,
  - text: |
    by trading services with them, 
  - text: |
    It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children
  - text: |
    and  that's something that we're struggling with now 
  - text: |
     but  you still have to be realistic, as well, I think 
  - text: |
    Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children 
  - text: |
    It is such an honor and a thrill, to be a parent, that most of the time, it's worth it
  - text: |
    It's not always worth it
  - text: |
    There are those times when I think, gee,  if I didn't have children I could be out playing  (( bridge ))  or golf 
  - text: |
    it's just a scary thing 
  - text: |
    were leaving them  ((   ))  small children
  - text: |
    we also learned something from that experience as our children got older 
  - text: |
    It's that care givers are not omniscient -- 
  - text: |
     -- they are not all things to all people --
  - text: |
     -- or all children 
  - text: |
    The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers 
  - text: |
    I'm sure that's a whole new ball game 
  - text: |
    I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby
  - text: |
    since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them  <<Voices fading in and out>> 
  - text: |
    you don't know what happens after they get in school 
  - text: |
    the other one, of course can't do the same thing
  - text: |
    and  no  it's not adequate to sit and wait
  - text: |
    we are helping,  you know
  - text: |
    You don't understand this 
  - text: |
    it's almost everyday 
  - text: |
    I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe 
  - text: |
    ((   ))  hit for many years -
  - text: |
    ((   )) because  I didn't need it 
  - text: |
    now, I need it
  - text: |
    Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure 
  - text: |
    it stays low a lot <laughter>
  - text: |
    the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
  - text: |
    That's just a difference in kids, I suppose 
  - text: |
    How unfortunate <laughter> 
  - text: |
    But I do hear my friends talk about it 
  - text: |
    my wife and I were both only children 
  - text: |
    we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends 
  - text: |
    Wrong 
  - text: |
    By the time the youngest ones are there, you'll have older one to take care of them 
  - text: |
    It really is 
  - text: |
    And then  you don't really know what happened

  - text: |
    I'm sure 
  - text: |
    Of course

    They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends
  - text: |
    It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally 
  - text: |
    it's just a matter of trust, you know
  - text: |
    I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and  underpaid, 
  - text: |
    I think that sort of goes hand in hand 
  - text: |
    And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
  - text: |
    that worked for a while,  
  - text: |
    but adequate ones were really tough to find
  - text: |
    I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers
  - text: |
    she and her roommate became live-in care givers  
  - text: |
    they loved it
  - text: |
    They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school
  - text: |
    she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
  - text: |
    they had done such a good job 
  - text: |
    So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that 
  - text: |
    I think it's just a matter of priorities  
  - text: |
    it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way
  - text: |
    that's bad to have to admit, too, 
  - text: |
    but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 
  - text: |
    I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children 
  - text: |
    it's just such a responsibility
  - text: |
    when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>
  - text: |
    Well, I realize that's true  
  - text: |
    so, it's such a responsibility 
  - text: |
    I just have to be honest about it  
  - text: |
    it's funny
  - text: |
    I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
  - text: |
    she got older 
  - text: |
    she said, we never do those things anyway 
  - text: |
    why am I waiting
  - text: |
    It's just the way your attitude changes 
  - text: |
    you mature I suppose 
  - text: |
    But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work 
  - text: |
    It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, 
  - text: |
     but, you know,  they need the money  
  - text: |
    And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,
  - text: |
    we were lucky when our children were that age, 
  - text: |
    having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
  - text: |
    And felt that feeling of safety
  - text: |
    I think your patience level needs to increase as the child gets older <laughter>
  - text: |
    I think that might be part of the problem with some people You know,   
  - text: |
    taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,  
  - text: |
    but when you have them in, their little feet are moving 
  - text: |
    you have to chase them down constantly 
  - text: |
    you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, - 
  - text: |
    <Laughter> That's something altogether different
  - text: |
    Now we have one takes piano lessons
  - text: |
     somewhere  on one afternoon  
  - text: |
    It has to be somewhere else  
  - text: |
    We are being cooperative,  
  - text: |
    That's just the way their minds work  
  - text: |
    It's amazing that people actually, - 
  - text: |
    the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it 
  - text: |
    It must be interesting  
  - text: |
    I've been finding out that I really am a nice person
  - text: |
    I mean one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where
  - text: |
    it's the one that's going downhill,
  - text: |
    I'm living in a dream world, 
  - text: |
    what do I know  
  - text: |
    As I said, I don't have kids  
  - text: |
    I'm an only child 
  - text: |
    so  I've never been around children  
  - text: |
    So I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned 
  - text: |
    we're having such fun
  - text: |
    <Laughter>  That's like World War Three every minute <laughter>  
  - text: |
    I have to admit, I was selfish as a child 
  - text: |
    I didn't want a brother or sister  
  - text: |
    now that I'm older, of course, it's different 
  - text: |
    I think about, wouldn't it be nice, 
  - text: |
    I have wonderful friends  
  - text: |
    my best friend is one child of ten  
  - text: |
    they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child 
  - text: |
    so that worked out pretty well  
  - text: |
    She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,  
  - text: |
    so I guess, that's an alternative  
  - text: |
    If you could just, have a whole bunch <laughter>
  - text: |
    When you see all these horror stories on television about child care  
  - text: |
    gosh
  - text: |
    I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories  
  - text: |
    of course people are denying it 
  - text: |
    it's just frightening 
  - text: |
    what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really don't understand
  - text: |
