       and then 
  - text: |
       and finishing 
  - text: |
       now go right from the diamond mine 
  - text: |
       until you come to the level of some flat rocks 
  - text: |
       until you are still above the desert 
  - text: |
       and go underneath the buffalo 
  - text: |
       when youre over the top of that and vertically in line with the apache camp go south 
  - text: |
       when you reach the apache camp 
  - text: |
       and go bel-- 
  - text: |
       so youre going to 
  - text: |
       well youre going to go from above the apache camp to the walled city 
  - text: |
       and come out at the left-hand side of the fort 
  - text: |
       then go slightly to your right beyond the flat rocks 
  - text: |
       so avoid the saloon bar 
  - text: |
       youve got to avoid that i think 
  - text: |
       and then slightly up underneath the flat rocks and above the stone creek 
  - text: |
       so that youre on the right of the buffalo 
  - text: |
       so youve got

       until you are above the level of the buffalo 
  - text: |
       go along 
  - text: |
       see when youre over the top of the fast or your creek or the river that ive got here 
  - text: |
       now youre starting above the diamond mine 
  - text: |
       and then when you reach the far your left-hand side of the walled city travel southwards 
  - text: |
       so youre go from the buffalo to the fort 
  - text: |
       then just straight down to the right of the buffalo 
  - text: |
       and then youre go up and over the top of the 
  - text: |
       so go south down past the walled city underneath your ghost town 
  - text: |
       as you reach the creek 
  - text: |
       and then go over and round the creek to your right 
  - text: |
       over the cattle ranch underneath buffalo or over the cattle ranch 
  - text: |
       not beside but on the same level as the the carved wooden pole 
  - text: |
       go along to your right and veer slightly upwards 
  - text: |
       now go south from the diamond mine 
  - text: |
       so youre going from above the apache camp the carved wooden pole and over the top of the walled city 
  - text: |
       and then slightly up 
  - text: |
       so you need to go up on a sort of hill 
  - text: |
       and so youre pass by the graveyard as well 
  - text: |
       the base of the carved wooden pole 
  - text: |
       but youve got to avoid the cattle ranch on the way 
  - text: |
       which on my map is halfway between the buffalo and the fort 
  - text: |
       and youll have to go up and over the top of the cattle ranch 
  - text: |
       then underneath the fort 
  - text: |
       and now youve got to pass 
  - text: |
       so what i want you to do is go between the flat rocks and stone creek 
  - text: |
       but youve got to avoid a carved wooden pole 
  - text: |
       sort of northeast direction between the flat rocks and the stone creek
