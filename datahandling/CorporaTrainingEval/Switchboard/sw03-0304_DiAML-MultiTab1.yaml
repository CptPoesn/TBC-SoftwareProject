      there are a lot of pine trees,

  - text: |
      but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
  - text: |
      and I enter things in our little state fair,
  - text: |
      and I'm enjoying it.  
  - text: |
      I think they're too far away from me,
  - text: |
      it's really neat
  - text: |
      I'm sort of in an antique business

      I've only been to Texas once
  - text: |
      so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,  
  - text: |
      and then when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
  - text: |
      but it's mostly oaks
  - text: |
      escape
  - text: |
      that's pretty neat
  - text: |
      it's really different because  that's the chalk hills down there,
  - text: |
      actually, I'm not even sure
  - text: |
      But they seem to like it okay.
  - text: |
       I'm building a log house at a  farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here

      I've skied in Colorado
  - text: |
       I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas

      Copper is kind of my favorite up there.
  - text: |
      it's just north of me here
  - text: |
      I guess those are the only places I've skied up there
  - text: |
      so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
  - text: |
      and that's pretty fun.
  - text: |
      I can hardly wait to get up there
  - text: |
      actually my hobbies mostly  is my sports. Tennis,
  - text: |
      but it's a little part time thing

      We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly, in Oregon 
  - text: |
       I play tennis
  - text: |
      and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
  - text: |
      I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
