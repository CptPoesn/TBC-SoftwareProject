      I've only been to Texas once
  - text: |
      so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,  
  - text: |
       I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas
  - text: |
       I'm building a log house at a  farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here
  - text: |
      we snow ski
  - text: |
      I've skied in Colorado
  - text: |
      it's really neat
  - text: |
      My sisters both seem to like it pretty well
  - text: |
      of course there's still a lot of work to be done,  
  - text: |
      But they seem to like it okay.
  - text: |
      actually, I'm not even sure
  - text: |

      it's low hills

      I am a travel agent at heart
  - text: |
      there are a lot of pine trees,
  - text: |
      and I ski
  - text: |
      but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
  - text: |
      I love traveling and being involved in that and finding out more
  - text: |
      he's got a job  there
  - text: |
      and I enter things in our little state fair,
  - text: |
      that's pretty neat
  - text: |
      and I'm enjoying it.  
  - text: |
      I'm sort of in an antique business

      so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
  - text: |
      and that's pretty fun.
