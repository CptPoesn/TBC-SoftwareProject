  - text: |
      escape
  - text: |
      he's got a job  there
  - text: |
      it's really different because  that's the chalk hills down there,
  - text: |
      But it's beautiful
  - text: |
      it's low hills
  - text: |
      and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight
  - text: |
       it's great, 
  - text: |
      we snow ski
  - text: |
      I think they're too far away from me,
  - text: |
      course I've been working on it for five years
  - text: |
      I am a travel agent at heart
  - text: |
      and I ski
  - text: |
      it's really neat
  - text: |
      so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,  
  - text: |
      But they seem to like it okay.
  - text: |
      and this is his first year
  - text: |
      but it's mostly oaks
  - text: |
      I'm sort of in an antique business
  - text: |
      and then when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
  - text: |
      of course there's still a lot of work to be done,  
  - text: |
       I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas
  - text: |
      and I'm enjoying it.  
  - text: |
      and I enter things in our little state fair,
  - text: |
       I'm building a log house at a  farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here
  - text: |
      I had never been there
  - text: |
      there are a lot of pine trees,
  - text: |
      I love traveling and being involved in that and finding out more
  - text: |
      Me, too
  - text: |
      I'm around my kids  
  - text: |
      actually, I'm not even sure
  - text: |
      but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
  - text: |
      that's pretty neat
  - text: |
      it's Eastern Hardwood, forest,

      Wonderful place.
  - text: |
      we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper
  - text: |
      I love tennis too
  - text: |
      Copper is kind of my favorite up there.
  - text: |
      I heard Aspen got three feet
  - text: |
      I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
  - text: |
      I thought Austin was beautiful
  - text: |
       I play tennis
  - text: |
      it's getting real close to 
  - text: |
      I guess those are the only places I've skied up there
  - text: |
       I liked the hills and the trees
  - text: |
      it's just north of me here
  - text: |
      I substitute at the schools part-time
  - text: |
      so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
  - text: |
      We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly, in Oregon 
  - text: |
      but it's a little part time thing
  - text: |
      and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
  - text: |
      except for time in service
  - text: |
      and that's pretty fun.
  - text: |
      He's admissions director
  - text: |
      I can hardly wait to get up there
  - text: |
      but maybe some day they can get closer
