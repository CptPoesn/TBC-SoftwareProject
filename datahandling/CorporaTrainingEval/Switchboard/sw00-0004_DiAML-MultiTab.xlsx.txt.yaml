      they know what's good and what isn't
  - text: |
      he fixes it
  - text: |
      we have Social Security numbers
  - text: |
      It's kind of like do it in the similar vein like VCR or television repair
  - text: |
      talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases
  - text: |
      if he comes in and says  I'll repair your VCR or somebody else's VCR for a hundred dollars gets in there
  - text: |
      They're real difficult to catch
  - text: |
      your defense attorney presents their evidence  
  - text: |
      we can be called at work  
  - text: |
      I lived in Germany 
  - text: |
      they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,  /
  - text: |
      when you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty
  - text: |
      <breathing> they're not aimed at the criminal  
  - text: |
      I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it
  - text: |
      and in Germany they don't have the jury system
  - text: |
      you wouldn't have this theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury
  - text: |
      What they do is they have three judges basically
  - text: |
      we have telephones
  - text: |
      and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas we write a check
  - text: |
      I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about
  - text: |
      I think to begin with you would have
  - text: |
      they went to a trial by jury
  - text: |
      maybe it's a blown fuse
  - text: |
      you can't use this as evidence
  - text: |
      I would have to look at it
  - text: |
      he still charges you that hundred dollars
  - text: |
      maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case
  - text: |
      and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it
  - text: |
      takes him two minutes
  - text: |
      If you take your TV in a lot of these TV repair places will say  well  I'll repair your TV for a hundred dollars
  - text: |
      he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars
  - text: |
      and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence  
  - text: |
      like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical
  - text: |
      I've nailed the problem down  
  - text: |
      because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
  - text: |
      and then the judge says no disregard that
  - text: |
      The judicial system is aimed at the citizens  
  - text: |
      they can trace us down
  - text: |
      All the people signed confessions
  - text: |
      if they did it with just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
  - text: |
      actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years
  - text: |
      because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures
  - text: |
      my favorite is the police department
  - text: |
      because you and I we have work schedules
  - text: |
      what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done
  - text: |
      we have a family called All day family
  - text: |
       Criminals have none of these things
  - text: |
      then we have checkbooks
  - text: |
      And you get up there

      I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from
  - text: |
      that's it.
  - text: |
      None of this
  - text: |
      our judicial system is in such total chaos
  - text: |
      They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals
  - text: |
      I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself
  - text: |
      but I
  - text: |
      Come on any jury's not going to  disregard the evidence you know <laughter>
  - text: |
      yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets
  - text: |
      I hold it in the utmost contempt
  - text: |
      those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not
  - text: |
      They been trying these people now for twentytwo years ever since I was a child
  - text: |
       has nothing to do with justice whatsoever
  - text: |
      So where do you think they target their efforts?

      They were all murdered
