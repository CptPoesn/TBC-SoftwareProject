  - text: |
      I also read one or two papers a day 
  - text: |
      I read the local newspaper
  - text: |
      I tune in to CNN a lot. 
  - text: |
      every evening at six thirty, I believe, I watch the national news
  - text: |
      I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that.
  - text: |
      I watch the national news every day, for one,

- intent: inform_continue
  examples:
  - text: |
      NEW YORK TIMES is okay
  - text: |
      because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope,
  - text: |
      I like listening to that when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it, because I
  - text: |
      I miss NPR a lot also
  - text: |
      but, I don't know, I think if you listen to like NPR or something like
  - text: |
      and I guess that's good when it's live, if you'll really want that
  - text: |
      and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news
  - text: |
      I take away a addiction <laughter>
  - text: |
      but when you read a lot of this stuff, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
  - text: |
      but I guess it's still a lot of hype
  - text: |
      For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, a couple of newspapers
  - text: |
      Neil and Lehrer, they're pretty good too
  - text: |
      because of the poor service and also because I give to the United Way
  - text: |
      that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible, 
  - text: |
      I'm a news junkie
  - text: |
      I don't know,
  - text: |
      I don't subscribe to cable
  - text: |
      overall, the quality of the news you get of most sources I would say is pretty low. 
  - text: |
      so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads
  - text: |
      usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
  - text: |
      I really like them because they give, instead of being, as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which i think is good
  - text: |
      I guess one of them is leaving.
  - text: |
      because my fiance - she was unemployed for a while 
  - text: |
      they say it's  like the sixth grade reading level
  - text: |
      but then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good.
  - text: |
      I had some visitor, he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, just listened to it constantly
  - text: |
      I would probably be a junkie or watch <laughter> CNN a lot

      but that's not really providing you news. 
  - text: |
      their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing
  - text: |
      still, you know, hard to say that what you've heard is what really is.
  - text: |
      but I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes.
  - text: |
      Had that invasion or whatever it is
  - text: |
      I mean, that was a joke
  - text: |
      I really like NPR a lot
  - text: |
       Oh, something
  - text: |
      I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.
