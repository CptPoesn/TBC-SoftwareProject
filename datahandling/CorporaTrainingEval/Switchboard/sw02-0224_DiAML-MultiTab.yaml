      what's wrong with you

      And what do they say about finding adequate child care? 

- intent: inform_pass
  examples:
  - text: |
      How unfortunate <laughter> 
  - text: |
      Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children 
  - text: |
      it's just a scary thing 
  - text: |
      That's just a difference in kids, I suppose 
  - text: |
      it's almost everyday 
  - text: |
      ((   ))  hit for many years -
  - text: |
      the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
  - text: |
      It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children
  - text: |
       -- or all children 
  - text: |
      I'm sure that's a whole new ball game 
  - text: |
      you don't know what happens after they get in school 
  - text: |
      now, I need it
  - text: |
      by trading services with them, 
  - text: |
      at one point in time we've had au pairs,
  - text: |
      You don't understand this 
  - text: |
      were leaving them  ((   ))  small children
  - text: |
      and  that's something that we're struggling with now 
  - text: |
      It is such an honor and a thrill, to be a parent, that most of the time, it's worth it
  - text: |
      I think that may be the key word 
  - text: |
      It's not always worth it
  - text: |
      so it's difficult for them
  - text: |
      Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure 
  - text: |
      we also learned something from that experience as our children got older 
  - text: |
      the other one, of course can't do the same thing
  - text: |
      we are helping,  you know
  - text: |
       -- they are not all things to all people --
  - text: |
       but  you still have to be realistic, as well, I think 
  - text: |
      since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them  <<Voices fading in and out>> 
  - text: |
      our children are now eleven and nine 
  - text: |
      ((   )) because  I didn't need it 
  - text: |
      The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers 
  - text: |
      and  no  it's not adequate to sit and wait
  - text: |
      it stays low a lot <laughter>
  - text: |
      There are those times when I think, gee,  if I didn't have children I could be out playing  (( bridge ))  or golf 
  - text: |
      I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby
  - text: |
      we moved away from institutionalized child care --
  - text: |
      I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe 
  - text: |
      It's that care givers are not omniscient -- 

- intent: agreement
  examples:
  - text: |
      No  
  - text: |
      Of course 
  - text: |
      yes
  - text: |
      it certainly is
  - text: |
      No 
  - text: |
      we certainly found that to be true 
  - text: |
      yeah
  - text: |
      I think that's correct  
  - text: |
      <Laughter>  You can't do that  
  - text: |
      that will not do 
  - text: |
      of course not 
  - text: |
      I'm sure 
  - text: |
      That's out of the question,  
  - text: |
      Most of the time <laughter> 

- intent: inform_continue
  examples:
  - text: |
      they loved it
  - text: |
      That's just the way their minds work  
  - text: |
      she and her roommate became live-in care givers  
  - text: |
      it's just such a responsibility
  - text: |
      I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and  underpaid, 
  - text: |
      And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
  - text: |
      you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, - 
  - text: |
      It must be interesting  
  - text: |
      she said, we never do those things anyway 
  - text: |
      taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,  
  - text: |
      you have to chase them down constantly 
  - text: |
      I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children 
  - text: |
      why am I waiting
  - text: |
      I think your patience level needs to increase as the child gets older <laughter>
  - text: |
      that worked for a while,  
  - text: |
      I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers
  - text: |
      I think it's just a matter of priorities  
  - text: |
      but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 
  - text: |
      It's amazing that people actually, - 
  - text: |
      it's the one that's going downhill,
  - text: |
      when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>
  - text: |
      you mature I suppose 
  - text: |
      so, it's such a responsibility 
  - text: |
      I mean one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where
  - text: |
      she got older 
  - text: |
      It has to be somewhere else  
  - text: |
      the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it 
  - text: |
      we were lucky when our children were that age, 
  - text: |
      Now we have one takes piano lessons
  - text: |
      having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
  - text: |
      I've been finding out that I really am a nice person
  - text: |
      she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
  - text: |
      Well, I realize that's true  
  - text: |
      it's just a matter of trust, you know
  - text: |
      It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, 
  - text: |
       somewhere  on one afternoon  
  - text: |
      It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally 
  - text: |
      And felt that feeling of safety
  - text: |
      they had done such a good job 
  - text: |
      it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way
  - text: |
      But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work 
  - text: |
      that's bad to have to admit, too, 
  - text: |
      I think that might be part of the problem with some people You know,   
  - text: |
      They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school
  - text: |
      So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that 
  - text: |
      It's just the way your attitude changes 
  - text: |
      it's funny
  - text: |
      We are being cooperative,  
  - text: |
      They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends
  - text: |
      I think that sort of goes hand in hand 
  - text: |
       but, you know,  they need the money  
  - text: |
      but adequate ones were really tough to find
  - text: |
      I just have to be honest about it  
  - text: |
      I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
  - text: |
      but when you have them in, their little feet are moving 
  - text: |
      <Laughter> That's something altogether different
  - text: |
      And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,
