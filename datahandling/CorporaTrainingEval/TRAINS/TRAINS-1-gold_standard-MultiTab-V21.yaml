      because that's where the orange juice factory is
  - text: |
      I want to determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that I can get to Bath by seven a.m. tomorrow
  - text: |
      but I think that we can't even put them in to
  - text: |
      we could actually take like engine E
  - text: |
      but the thing is that I was thinking if we could actually pick up those two boxcars which are at Bath
  - text: |
      so we're like screwed as far as those two box cars at Bath
  - text: |
      like I don't think we so to get the maximum number of box cars of oranges to bath by seven am I don't think we can even use those two at Bath
  - text: |
      we have the three boxcars at Dansville
  - text: |
      have it go to Bath pick up those two box cars
  - text: |
      I guess all the boxcars will have to go through Corning
  - text: |
      we can unload any amount of cargo onto a train in one hour
  - text: |
      that they won't even come in to

  - text: |
      to Corning

      orange factory

    metadata:

      that's six hours 
  - text: |
      four hours

      three hours
  - text: |
      two hours

- intent: checkQuestion
  examples:
  - text: |
      an hour I guess
  - text: |
      so we can actually use those three boxcars right
    metadata:
      turnManagement: turnAssign
  - text: |
      every trip will take at least three hours then
  - text: |
      and it's gonna take us also an hour to load boxcars right

- intent: inform_pass
  examples:
  - text: |

  - text: |
      it's shorter through Dansville
  - text: |
      because we can't get an engine to Bath in time

- intent: suggest
  examples:
  - text: |
      I guess one thing we can do
  - text: |
      I guess one thing is that we should see how many boxcars we can actually get to Corning in four hours
