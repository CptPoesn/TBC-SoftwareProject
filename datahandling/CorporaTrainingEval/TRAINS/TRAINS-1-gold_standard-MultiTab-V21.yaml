  - text: |
      I want to determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that I can get to Bath by seven a.m. tomorrow
  - text: |
      we can unload any amount of cargo onto a train in one hour
  - text: |
      we have the three boxcars at Dansville
  - text: |
      we could actually take like engine E
  - text: |
      I guess all the boxcars will have to go through Corning
  - text: |
      have it go to Bath pick up those two box cars
  - text: |
      because that's where the orange juice factory is
  - text: |
      that they won't even come in to
  - text: |
      but the thing is that I was thinking if we could actually pick up those two boxcars which are at Bath
  - text: |
      so we're like screwed as far as those two box cars at Bath
  - text: |
      but I think that we can't even put them in to

- intent: selfcorrection

  - text: |
      that they won't even come in to

      orange factory

      from Corning to Bath how far is that
    metadata:
      turnManagement: turnAssign
  - text: |
      how far is it from Avon to Danville
  - text: |
      I thought well from like Elmira through to Corning to Bath is many hours
  - text: |
      how far is it from Avon to Bath

- intent: answer
  examples:
  - text: |
      one hour
  - text: |
      three hours
  - text: |
      that's six hours 
  - text: |
      two hours
  - text: |
      four hours

- intent: checkquestion
  examples:
  - text: |
      every trip will take at least three hours then
  - text: |
      and it's gonna take us also an hour to load boxcars right
    metadata:
      turnManagement: turnAssign
  - text: |
      an hour I guess
  - text: |
      so we can actually use those three boxcars right

  examples:
  - text: |
      we can do a maximum of three boxcars in an hour
  - text: |
      it's shorter through Dansville
  - text: |
      because we can't get an engine to Bath in time

- intent: suggest
  examples:
  - text: |
      I guess one thing is that we should see how many boxcars we can actually get to Corning in four hours
  - text: |
      I guess one thing we can do
