      Of course 
  - text: |
      I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
  - text: |
      it is snowing right now
  - text: |
      every evening at six thirty, I believe, I watch the national news
  - text: |
      University of Texas in Dallas
  - text: |
      I do have friends that have children
  - text: |
      I watch the national news every day, for one,
  - text: |
      yeah
  - text: |
      I read the local newspaper
  - text: |
      so basically I'm just real busy with my kids right now in sports
  - text: |
      I tune in to CNN a lot.

      I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that.
  - text: |
      Copper
  - text: |
      I also read one or two papers a day 

- intent: inform_continue
  examples:
  - text: |
      my best friend is one child of ten  
  - text: |
      so that worked out pretty well  
  - text: |
      I'm a news junkie
  - text: |
      we are on the dry side of the mountains
  - text: |
      it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way
  - text: |
      and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight
  - text: |
      it's low hills
  - text: |
      we snow ski
  - text: |
      that's bad to have to admit, too, 
  - text: |
      I think they're too far away from me,
  - text: |
      you mature I suppose 
  - text: |
      it's just frightening 
  - text: |
      because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope,
  - text: |
      I guess one of them is leaving.
  - text: |
      Well, I realize that's true  
  - text: |
      But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work 
  - text: |
      and I ski
  - text: |
      she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
  - text: |
      I'm sort of in an antique business
  - text: |
      what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really don't understand
  - text: |
      of course there's still a lot of work to be done,  
  - text: |
      and I'm enjoying it.  
  - text: |
      I miss NPR a lot also
  - text: |
      I think it's just a matter of priorities  
  - text: |
      they say it's  like the sixth grade reading level
  - text: |
      but, I don't know, I think if you listen to like NPR or something like
  - text: |
       I'm building a log house at a  farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here
  - text: |
      because of the poor service and also because I give to the United Way
  - text: |
      when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>
  - text: |
      <Laughter>  That's like World War Three every minute <laughter>  
  - text: |
      and we're on the colder side,
  - text: |
      but when you read a lot of this stuff, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
  - text: |
      so I guess, that's an alternative  
  - text: |
      Neil and Lehrer, they're pretty good too
  - text: |
      We are being cooperative,  
  - text: |
      I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories  
  - text: |
      I've skied in Colorado
  - text: |
      I would probably be a junkie or watch <laughter> CNN a lot
  - text: |
      he's got a job  there
  - text: |
      I'm living in a dream world, 
  - text: |
      I've been finding out that I really am a nice person
  - text: |
      course I've been working on it for five years
  - text: |
      of course people are denying it 
  - text: |
      one of the ways that I get information is, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing
  - text: |
      but when you have them in, their little feet are moving 
  - text: |
      so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,  
  - text: |
      and this is his first year
  - text: |
      As I said, I don't have kids  
  - text: |
      It's amazing that people actually, - 
  - text: |
      and then when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
  - text: |
       I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas
  - text: |
      she said, we never do those things anyway 
  - text: |
      And felt that feeling of safety
  - text: |
      It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, 
  - text: |
      as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion, which I would  be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
  - text: |
      And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
  - text: |
      they had done such a good job 
  - text: |
      I have wonderful friends  
  - text: |
      why am I waiting
  - text: |
      I have to admit, I was selfish as a child 
  - text: |
      I had never been there
  - text: |
      they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child 
  - text: |
      NEW YORK TIMES is okay
  - text: |
      I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children 
  - text: |
      I don't subscribe to cable
  - text: |
      So I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned 
  - text: |
      Me, too
  - text: |
      and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news
  - text: |
      I think your patience level needs to increase as the child gets older <laughter>
  - text: |
      now that I'm older, of course, it's different 
  - text: |
      When you see all these horror stories on television about child care  
  - text: |
       -- tied in a chair
  - text: |
      I like listening to that when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it, because I
  - text: |
      it's free inside the company
  - text: |
      I think that might be part of the problem with some people You know,   
  - text: |
      you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, - 
  - text: |
      gosh
  - text: |
      that's pretty neat
  - text: |
      it's Eastern Hardwood, forest,  
  - text: |
      I'm an only child 
  - text: |
      My brother-in-law works for the University, in Dallas
  - text: |
      they're pretty g
  - text: |
      escape
  - text: |
      I really like them because they give, instead of being, as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which i think is good
  - text: |
      But it's beautiful
  - text: |
      I just have to be honest about it  
  - text: |
      it's really different because  that's the chalk hills down there,
  - text: |
      overall, the quality of the news you get of most sources I would say is pretty low. 
  - text: |
      we're on the snowy side
  - text: |
      but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while
  - text: |
      I don't know,
  - text: |
      I guess that's true
  - text: |
      They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends
  - text: |
      But they seem to like it okay.
  - text: |
      That's just the way their minds work  
  - text: |
      it's called INTELLECT
  - text: |
      It's just the way your attitude changes 
  - text: |
      having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
  - text: |
      I had some visitor, he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, just listened to it constantly
  - text: |
      but I guess it's still a lot of hype
  - text: |
      Now we have one takes piano lessons
  - text: |
      we ski
  - text: |
      It has to be somewhere else  
  - text: |
      there are a lot of pine trees,
  - text: |
      I take away a addiction <laughter>
  - text: |
      they're on the rainy side
  - text: |
      you have to chase them down constantly 
  - text: |
      It must be interesting  
  - text: |
      I'm around my kids  
  - text: |
      where obviously she
  - text: |
      actually, I'm not even sure
  - text: |
      but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 
  - text: |
      she and her roommate became live-in care givers  
  - text: |
      taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,  
  - text: |
      so, it's such a responsibility 
  - text: |
      My sisters both seem to like it pretty well
  - text: |
      She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,  
  - text: |
      she got older 
  - text: |
      what do I know  
  - text: |
      I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers
  - text: |
      I've only been to Texas once
  - text: |
      but that's if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report, somebody else's view about it
  - text: |
      I think that sort of goes hand in hand 
  - text: |
      We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of ribbon
  - text: |
      usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
  - text: |
      the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it 
  - text: |
       it's great, 
  - text: |
      and I guess that's good when it's live, if you'll really want that
  - text: |
      they loved it
  - text: |
      because my fiance - she was unemployed for a while 
  - text: |
      It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally 
  - text: |
      it's the one that's going downhill,
  - text: |
      so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads
  - text: |
      I didn't want a brother or sister  
  - text: |
      So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that 
  - text: |
      we're having such fun
  - text: |
      I am a travel agent at heart
  - text: |
      it's just a matter of trust, you know
  - text: |
      it's really neat
  - text: |
       somewhere  on one afternoon  
  - text: |
      but it's mostly oaks
  - text: |
      that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible, 
  - text: |
      <Laughter> That's something altogether different
  - text: |
      it's just such a responsibility
  - text: |
      but then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good.
  - text: |
      They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school
  - text: |
      so  I've never been around children  
  - text: |
      If you could just, have a whole bunch <laughter>
  - text: |
      and I enter things in our little state fair,
  - text: |
      I think about, wouldn't it be nice, 
  - text: |
      if you watch the news, your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it
  - text: |
      it's funny
  - text: |
      I love traveling and being involved in that and finding out more
  - text: |
      we were lucky when our children were that age, 
  - text: |
      they basically, type out abstracts which are really literally, -
  - text: |
      that worked for a while,  
  - text: |
      but adequate ones were really tough to find
  - text: |
      I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and  underpaid, 
  - text: |
      For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, a couple of newspapers
  - text: |
      I mean one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where
  - text: |
      I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
  - text: |
      but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
  - text: |
       but, you know,  they need the money  
  - text: |
      I've actually read the actual articles
  - text: |
      Seattle is only about two and a half hours
  - text: |
      And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,

      Ooh.

      yeah
  - text: |
      that's great

      Sure  
  - text: |
      That's a big plus
  - text: |
      That's great.
  - text: |
      Huh-uh

      That's amazing

       I can imagine, my lord

      Ooh

      Oh,  wow

      but how wonderful

      yes

      Yeah

      All right

      Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure 
  - text: |
      That's kind of boring to me, I think
  - text: |
      Wonderful place.
  - text: |
      but that's not really providing you news. 
  - text: |
      ((   )) because  I didn't need it 
  - text: |
      I heard Aspen got three feet
  - text: |
      How unfortunate <laughter> 
  - text: |
      I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
  - text: |
      I really like NPR a lot
  - text: |
       but  you still have to be realistic, as well, I think 
  - text: |
       Oh, something
  - text: |
       I liked the hills and the trees
  - text: |
      I think that may be the key word 
  - text: |
      it's just north of me here
  - text: |
      I substitute at the schools part-time
  - text: |
      But I do hear my friends talk about it 
  - text: |
      so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
  - text: |
      and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
  - text: |
      except for time in service
  - text: |
      and that's pretty fun.
  - text: |
      at one point in time we've had au pairs,
  - text: |
      Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children 
  - text: |
      were leaving them  ((   ))  small children
  - text: |
      we are helping,  you know
  - text: |
      I love tennis too
  - text: |
      Copper is kind of my favorite up there.
  - text: |
      now, I need it
  - text: |
      It's that care givers are not omniscient -- 
  - text: |
      we moved away from institutionalized child care --
  - text: |
      It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children
  - text: |
      ((   ))  hit for many years -
  - text: |
       -- they are not all things to all people --
  - text: |
      the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
  - text: |
      I'm sure that's a whole new ball game 
  - text: |
      We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly, in Oregon 
  - text: |
      but it's a little part time thing
  - text: |
      You don't understand this 
  - text: |
      their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing
  - text: |
      so it's difficult for them
  - text: |
      since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them  <<Voices fading in and out>> 
  - text: |
      the other one, of course can't do the same thing
  - text: |
      He's admissions director
  - text: |
      I can hardly wait to get up there
  - text: |
      but maybe some day they can get closer
  - text: |
      And then  you don't really know what happened 
  - text: |
      We're to get one to three inches tonight
  - text: |
      it's just a scary thing 
  - text: |
      It really is 
  - text: |
      my wife and I were both only children 
  - text: |
      we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends 
  - text: |
      actually my hobbies mostly  is my sports. Tennis,
  - text: |
      still, you know, hard to say that what you've heard is what really is.
  - text: |
      we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper
  - text: |
      That's just a difference in kids, I suppose 
  - text: |
      I mean, that was a joke
  - text: |
       I play tennis
  - text: |
      I thought Austin was beautiful
  - text: |
      so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
  - text: |
      you don't know what happens after they get in school 
  - text: |
      but I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes.
  - text: |
      and  no  it's not adequate to sit and wait
  - text: |
      by trading services with them, 
  - text: |
      it's more like a media event rather than reporting
  - text: |
      hair ribbon
  - text: |
      we also learned something from that experience as our children got older 
  - text: |
      it stays low a lot <laughter>
  - text: |
      I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.
  - text: |
      going over that pass is  just a real nightmare
  - text: |
      and  that's something that we're struggling with now 
  - text: |
      I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe 
  - text: |
      There are those times when I think, gee,  if I didn't have children I could be out playing  (( bridge ))  or golf 
  - text: |
      The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers 
  - text: |
      Wrong 
  - text: |
      our children are now eleven and nine 
  - text: |
      Had that invasion or whatever it is
  - text: |
      it's getting real close to 
  - text: |
      I guess those are the only places I've skied up there
  - text: |
      It is such an honor and a thrill, to be a parent, that most of the time, it's worth it
  - text: |
      it's almost everyday 
  - text: |
      I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby
  - text: |
       -- or all children 
  - text: |
      so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
  - text: |
      It's not always worth it
  - text: |
      By the time the youngest ones are there, you'll have older one to take care of them
