      Yes,

      I'm mother of four

      Copper

      I tune in to CNN a lot. 
  - text: |
      I  collect antique tools
  - text: |
      I watch the national news every day, for one,
  - text: |
      it is snowing right now
  - text: |
      I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
  - text: |
      Yeah
  - text: |
      I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that.
  - text: |
      I also read one or two papers a day 
  - text: |
      I read the local newspaper

  - text: |
      what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really don't understand
  - text: |
      We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of ribbon
  - text: |
      I guess that's true
  - text: |
      My sisters both seem to like it pretty well
  - text: |
      When you see all these horror stories on television about child care  
  - text: |
      so  I've never been around children  
  - text: |
      it's the one that's going downhill,
  - text: |
      I think your patience level needs to increase as the child gets older <laughter>
  - text: |
      but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
  - text: |
      I'm living in a dream world, 
  - text: |
      It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally 
  - text: |
      They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school
  - text: |
      I'm around my kids  
  - text: |
      that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible, 
  - text: |
      Well, I realize that's true  
  - text: |
      It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, 
  - text: |
      but then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good.
  - text: |
      but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 
  - text: |
      I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
  - text: |
      Now we have one takes piano lessons
  - text: |
      it's low hills
  - text: |
      but when you read a lot of this stuff, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
  - text: |
      she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
  - text: |
      when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>
  - text: |
      but adequate ones were really tough to find
  - text: |
      Neil and Lehrer, they're pretty good too
  - text: |
      It's just the way your attitude changes 
  - text: |
      I'm sort of in an antique business
  - text: |
      and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news
  - text: |
       but, you know,  they need the money  
  - text: |
      I don't know,
  - text: |
      I think it's just a matter of priorities  
  - text: |
       -- tied in a chair
  - text: |
      the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it 
  - text: |
      now that I'm older, of course, it's different 
  - text: |
      Seattle is only about two and a half hours
  - text: |
      escape
  - text: |
      they had done such a good job 
  - text: |
      I think they're too far away from me,
  - text: |
      overall, the quality of the news you get of most sources I would say is pretty low. 
  - text: |
      and I guess that's good when it's live, if you'll really want that
  - text: |
      we're having such fun
  - text: |
      of course people are denying it 
  - text: |
      it's just such a responsibility
  - text: |
      NEW YORK TIMES is okay
  - text: |
       I'm building a log house at a  farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here
  - text: |
      she got older 
  - text: |
      so I guess, that's an alternative  
  - text: |
      I just have to be honest about it  
  - text: |
      I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children 
  - text: |
      I miss NPR a lot also
  - text: |
      it's just a matter of trust, you know
  - text: |
      It has to be somewhere else  
  - text: |
      so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads
  - text: |
      My brother-in-law works for the University, in Dallas
  - text: |
      as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion, which I would  be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
  - text: |
      usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
  - text: |
      you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, - 
  - text: |
      but that's if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report, somebody else's view about it
  - text: |
      they basically, type out abstracts which are really literally, -
  - text: |
      But it's beautiful
  - text: |
      I would probably be a junkie or watch <laughter> CNN a lot
  - text: |
      but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while
  - text: |
       I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas
  - text: |
      I'm a news junkie
  - text: |
      if you watch the news, your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it
  - text: |
      And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,
  - text: |
      she and her roommate became live-in care givers  
  - text: |
      As I said, I don't have kids  
  - text: |
      it's Eastern Hardwood, forest,  
  - text: |
      my best friend is one child of ten  
  - text: |
      <Laughter> That's something altogether different
  - text: |
      it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way
  - text: |
      it's just frightening 
  - text: |
      course I've been working on it for five years
  - text: |
      and we're on the colder side,
  - text: |
      I take away a addiction <laughter>
  - text: |
      For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, a couple of newspapers
  - text: |
       somewhere  on one afternoon  
  - text: |
      So I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned 
  - text: |
      I think that sort of goes hand in hand 
  - text: |
      it's really neat
  - text: |
      and this is his first year
  - text: |
      But they seem to like it okay.
  - text: |
      there are a lot of pine trees,
  - text: |
      but it's mostly oaks
  - text: |
      And felt that feeling of safety
  - text: |
      I had never been there
  - text: |
      She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,  
  - text: |
      so that worked out pretty well  
  - text: |
      you have to chase them down constantly 
  - text: |
      they're pretty g
  - text: |
      but, I don't know, I think if you listen to like NPR or something like
  - text: |
      I think about, wouldn't it be nice, 
  - text: |
      why am I waiting
  - text: |
      I don't subscribe to cable
  - text: |
      and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight
  - text: |
      we ski
  - text: |
      I've skied in Colorado
  - text: |
      that's pretty neat
  - text: |
      I didn't want a brother or sister  
  - text: |
      actually, I'm not even sure
  - text: |
      and I ski
  - text: |
      he's got a job  there
  - text: |
      I'm an only child 
  - text: |
      I've been finding out that I really am a nice person
  - text: |
      they're on the rainy side
  - text: |
      I've actually read the actual articles
  - text: |
      <Laughter>  That's like World War Three every minute <laughter>  
  - text: |
      I have to admit, I was selfish as a child 
  - text: |
      and I enter things in our little state fair,
  - text: |
      you mature I suppose 
  - text: |
      and I'm enjoying it.  
  - text: |
      they say it's  like the sixth grade reading level
  - text: |
      Me, too
  - text: |
      they loved it
  - text: |
      I really like them because they give, instead of being, as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which i think is good
  - text: |
      it's really different because  that's the chalk hills down there,
  - text: |
      we're on the snowy side
  - text: |
      I think that might be part of the problem with some people You know,   
  - text: |
      that's bad to have to admit, too, 
  - text: |
      where obviously she
  - text: |
      we snow ski
  - text: |
      But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work 
  - text: |
      It must be interesting  
  - text: |
      We are being cooperative,  
  - text: |
      it's free inside the company
  - text: |
       it's great, 
  - text: |
      she said, we never do those things anyway 
  - text: |
      we were lucky when our children were that age, 
  - text: |
      I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers
  - text: |
      so, it's such a responsibility 
  - text: |
      having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
  - text: |
      I like listening to that when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it, because I
  - text: |
      and then when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
  - text: |
      If you could just, have a whole bunch <laughter>
  - text: |
      but I guess it's still a lot of hype
  - text: |
      I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and  underpaid, 
  - text: |
      but when you have them in, their little feet are moving 
  - text: |
      what do I know  
  - text: |
      I've only been to Texas once
  - text: |
      because of the poor service and also because I give to the United Way
  - text: |
      we are on the dry side of the mountains
  - text: |
      I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories  
  - text: |
      of course there's still a lot of work to be done,  
  - text: |
      I am a travel agent at heart
  - text: |
      so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,  
  - text: |
      that worked for a while,  
  - text: |
      I have wonderful friends  
  - text: |
      because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope,
  - text: |
      I guess one of them is leaving.
  - text: |
      taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,  
  - text: |
      That's just the way their minds work  
  - text: |
      I love traveling and being involved in that and finding out more
  - text: |
      I had some visitor, he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, just listened to it constantly
  - text: |
      because my fiance - she was unemployed for a while 
  - text: |
      it's funny
  - text: |
      I mean one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where
  - text: |
      they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child 
  - text: |
      it's called INTELLECT
  - text: |
      It's amazing that people actually, - 
  - text: |
      And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
  - text: |
      gosh
  - text: |
      So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that 
  - text: |
      They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends
  - text: |
      one of the ways that I get information is, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing

      No

      that's great

      No, kidding.

      Right. /
  - text: |
      <Laughter>
  - text: |
       Right   
  - text: |
      That's true  
  - text: |
      Yeah <laughter>  
  - text: |
      That's true 
  - text: |
      Ooh,
  - text: |
       Yeah

       Yeah   
  - text: |
      Pretty low

      Yeah,  
  - text: |
      Yeah
  - text: |
      That's great.
  - text: |
      but how wonderful
  - text: |
      Oh

       but  you still have to be realistic, as well, I think 
  - text: |
       -- or all children 
  - text: |
      I think that may be the key word 
  - text: |
      But I do hear my friends talk about it 
  - text: |
      There are those times when I think, gee,  if I didn't have children I could be out playing  (( bridge ))  or golf 
  - text: |
      By the time the youngest ones are there, you'll have older one to take care of them 
  - text: |
      Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children 
  - text: |
      I really like NPR a lot
  - text: |
      And then  you don't really know what happened 
  - text: |
      their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing
  - text: |
      we moved away from institutionalized child care --
  - text: |
      it stays low a lot <laughter>
  - text: |
      I mean, that was a joke
  - text: |
      The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers 
  - text: |
      Wrong 
  - text: |
      Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure 
  - text: |
      I substitute at the schools part-time
  - text: |
      It really is 
  - text: |
      still, you know, hard to say that what you've heard is what really is.
  - text: |
      It is such an honor and a thrill, to be a parent, that most of the time, it's worth it
  - text: |
      but maybe some day they can get closer
  - text: |
      at one point in time we've had au pairs,
  - text: |
      How unfortunate <laughter> 
  - text: |
      That's just a difference in kids, I suppose 
  - text: |
      the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
  - text: |
      Wonderful place.
  - text: |
      I figured that amount of money I just donate to that.
  - text: |
      we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper
  - text: |
      it's more like a media event rather than reporting
  - text: |
      It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children
  - text: |
      We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly, in Oregon 
  - text: |
      He's admissions director
  - text: |
      and that's pretty fun.
  - text: |
      and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
  - text: |
      I thought Austin was beautiful
  - text: |
      since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them  <<Voices fading in and out>> 
  - text: |
      it's almost everyday 
  - text: |
      we also learned something from that experience as our children got older 
  - text: |
      and  that's something that we're struggling with now 
  - text: |
      were leaving them  ((   ))  small children
  - text: |
      going over that pass is  just a real nightmare
  - text: |
      You don't understand this 
  - text: |
      so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
  - text: |
      That's kind of boring to me, I think
  - text: |
      we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends 
  - text: |
       -- they are not all things to all people --
  - text: |
      it's just north of me here
  - text: |
      by trading services with them, 
  - text: |
      I can hardly wait to get up there
  - text: |
      it's getting real close to 
  - text: |
      we are helping,  you know
  - text: |
      I heard Aspen got three feet
  - text: |
       I liked the hills and the trees
  - text: |
      ((   ))  hit for many years -
  - text: |
      It's not always worth it
  - text: |
      my wife and I were both only children 
  - text: |
      except for time in service
  - text: |
       Oh, something
  - text: |
      I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
  - text: |
      We're to get one to three inches tonight
  - text: |
      so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
  - text: |
      but I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes.
  - text: |
      I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe 
  - text: |
      but it's a little part time thing
  - text: |
      and  no  it's not adequate to sit and wait
  - text: |
      ((   )) because  I didn't need it 
  - text: |
       I play tennis
  - text: |
      the other one, of course can't do the same thing
  - text: |
      so it's difficult for them

  - text: |
      our children are now eleven and nine 
  - text: |
      but that's not really providing you news. 
  - text: |
      I'm sure that's a whole new ball game 
  - text: |
      Had that invasion or whatever it is
  - text: |
      I guess those are the only places I've skied up there
  - text: |
      it's just a scary thing 
  - text: |
      actually my hobbies mostly  is my sports. Tennis,
  - text: |
      I love tennis too
  - text: |
      Copper is kind of my favorite up there.
  - text: |
      you don't know what happens after they get in school 
  - text: |
      It's that care givers are not omniscient -- 
  - text: |
      I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby
  - text: |
      now, I need it
  - text: |
      so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
