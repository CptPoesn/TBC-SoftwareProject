      then I guess we can also take like engine E two with those two boxcars from Elmira take it to Corning
  - text: |
      because that's where the orange juice factory is
  - text: |
      and I can only use engine two it's all the way over here
  - text: |
      four p.m.
  - text: |
      I guess all the boxcars will have to go through Corning
  - text: |
      in Avon I want to load three box- drop off the one engine drop off the two tankers of OJ
  - text: |
      so that's three boxcars
  - text: |
      I want to determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that I can get to Bath by seven a.m. tomorrow
  - text: |
      we can unload any amount of cargo onto a train in one hour
  - text: |
      two tankers of OJ to Avon would mean I take engine two and take the two b(oxcars)- from Elmira and bring them over and pick up two and bring them back to Elmira to fill with OJ
  - text: |
      have it go to Bath pick up those two box cars
  - text: |
      like I don't think we so to get the maximum number of box cars of oranges to bath by seven am I don't think we can even use those two at Bath
  - text: |
      we have the three boxcars at Dansville
  - text: |
      but the thing is that I was thinking if we could actually pick up those two boxcars which are at Bath
  - text: |
      so we're like screwed as far as those two box cars at Bath
  - text: |
      I have a problem I need to transport two tankers of OJ to Avon and three boxcars of bananas to Elmira
  - text: |
      that they won't even come in to
  - text: |
      so that's good
  - text: |
      but I think that we can't even put them in to
  - text: |
      so that's engine E one from Avon going to Dansville pick up the three boxcars go to Corning load them up and then take it to Bath
  - text: |
      we could actually take like engine E
  - text: |
      the two tankers

- intent: inform_pass
  examples:
  - text: |
      load those three
  - text: |
      I guess I still have nine hours
  - text: |
      bring it with me with the other two to Avon
  - text: |
      it's shorter through Dansville
  - text: |
      we can do a maximum of three boxcars in an hour
  - text: |
      we'll get there by seven p.m.
  - text: |
      yeah that should also work
  - text: |
      it's now noon when you arrive in Avon
  - text: |
      bring them back to Elmira
  - text: |
      when I reach Dansville I wanna pick up one more boxcar
  - text: |
      I can only use engine two
  - text: |
      the bananas must arrive in Elmira by nine p.m.
  - text: |
      because we can't get an engine to Bath in time
  - text: |
      fill up the three boxcars with bananas
