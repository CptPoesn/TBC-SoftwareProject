      Copper

      so basically I'm just real busy with my kids right now in sports

      I've been to Telluride which is on the west side

      Of course 
  - text: |
      Breckenridge

      I do lots of cross stitching when I have time

      it is snowing right now

      I also read one or two papers a day

      I do have friends that have children
  - text: |
      Yeah
  - text: |
      University of Texas in Dallas
  - text: |
      I also try and read one of the major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that.
  - text: |
      I watch the national news every day, for one,

      No

  examples:
  - text: |
      I had never been there
  - text: |
      I'm living in a dream world, 
  - text: |
      it's just such a responsibility
  - text: |
      because if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on. You would hope,
  - text: |
      but I guess it's still a lot of hype
  - text: |
      overall, the quality of the news you get of most sources I would say is pretty low. 
  - text: |
      I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and  underpaid, 
  - text: |
      We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of ribbon
  - text: |
      and this is his first year
  - text: |
      And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
  - text: |
      and we're on the colder side,
  - text: |
      It must be interesting  
  - text: |
      usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
  - text: |
      you have to chase them down constantly 
  - text: |
      But it's beautiful
  - text: |
      I miss NPR a lot also
  - text: |
      when you hear people say, it alters your life forever, please take heed <laughter>
  - text: |
      you mature I suppose 
  - text: |
      so, it's such a responsibility 
  - text: |
      now that I'm older, of course, it's different 
  - text: |
      the stamina that you must draw from yourself to deal with it 
  - text: |
      where obviously she
  - text: |
      Well, I realize that's true  
  - text: |
      escape
  - text: |
      they had done such a good job 
  - text: |
      it's a terrible thing to say when you're speaking of children in that way
  - text: |
      I have wonderful friends  
  - text: |
      they just sort of adopted me as their eleventh child 
  - text: |
      I think that might be part of the problem with some people You know,   
  - text: |
      So I can see where someone, in a position like that, in a live-in capacity, would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial  to be able to do that 
  - text: |
      that's pretty neat
  - text: |
      I really like them because they give, instead of being, as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go really in depth on topics which i think is good
  - text: |
      that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible, 
  - text: |
      we are on the dry side of the mountains
  - text: |
      we're having such fun
  - text: |
      I take away a addiction <laughter>
  - text: |
      I guess one of them is leaving.
  - text: |
      I don't know,
  - text: |
      I'm around my kids  
  - text: |
      as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion, which I would  be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
  - text: |
      That's just the way their minds work  
  - text: |
       it's great, 
  - text: |
      so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads
  - text: |
      and I guess that's good when it's live, if you'll really want that
  - text: |
      I guess that's true
  - text: |
      and I ski
  - text: |
      there are a lot of pine trees,
  - text: |
      it's just frightening 
  - text: |
      you sound like you're pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about, - 
  - text: |
      she said, we never do those things anyway 
  - text: |
      taking care of a baby, I know, is not an easy thing,  
  - text: |
      they're on the rainy side
  - text: |
      I think they're too far away from me,
  - text: |
      I have to admit, I was selfish as a child 
  - text: |
      we ski
  - text: |
      I think your patience level needs to increase as the child gets older <laughter>
  - text: |
      that worked for a while,  
  - text: |
      it's Eastern Hardwood, forest,  
  - text: |
      because my fiance - she was unemployed for a while 
  - text: |
      I mean one of them I would leave unsupervised any time, any place, any where
  - text: |
      I've only been to Texas once
  - text: |
      but it's mostly oaks
  - text: |
      but then you also have things where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good.
  - text: |
      it's just a matter of trust, you know
  - text: |
      so that worked out pretty well  
  - text: |
      If you could just, have a whole bunch <laughter>
  - text: |
      that's bad to have to admit, too, 
  - text: |
      Seattle is only about two and a half hours
  - text: |
      They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old, up until they were well into grade school
  - text: |
      it's called INTELLECT
  - text: |
      it's funny
  - text: |
      actually, I'm not even sure
  - text: |
      They're, relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends
  - text: |
      but when you read a lot of this stuff, the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so
  - text: |
      we're on the snowy side
  - text: |
      I think that sort of goes hand in hand 
  - text: |
       but, you know,  they need the money  
  - text: |
      if you watch the news, your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it
  - text: |
      but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event, which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while
  - text: |
       I'm building a log house at a  farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here
  - text: |
      we snow ski
  - text: |
      My brother-in-law works for the University, in Dallas
  - text: |
      Me, too
  - text: |
      I am a travel agent at heart
  - text: |
      I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories  
  - text: |
      what's frightening is a parent to see things that you don't really don't understand
  - text: |
      but, I don't know, I think if you listen to like NPR or something like
  - text: |
      they loved it
  - text: |
      course I've been working on it for five years
  - text: |
      she and her roommate became live-in care givers  
  - text: |
      of course people are denying it 
  - text: |
      I had some visitor, he was just, I don't know, fixated on that, just listened to it constantly
  - text: |
      She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them,  
  - text: |
      and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight
  - text: |
      NEW YORK TIMES is okay
  - text: |
      they basically, type out abstracts which are really literally, -
  - text: |
      I've actually read the actual articles
  - text: |
      and I enter things in our little state fair,
  - text: |
      and I'm enjoying it.  
  - text: |
      I didn't want a brother or sister  
  - text: |
      I would probably be a junkie or watch <laughter> CNN a lot
  - text: |
      I like listening to that when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it, because I
  - text: |
      I think it's just a matter of priorities  
  - text: |
      but it's just, there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 
  - text: |
      It's amazing that people actually, - 
  - text: |
      My sisters both seem to like it pretty well
  - text: |
      It has to be somewhere else  
  - text: |
      it's free inside the company
  - text: |
      and then when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside
  - text: |
      having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
  - text: |
      she was paid very well because the parents trusted them
  - text: |
       somewhere  on one afternoon  
  - text: |
      It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he, as well, 
  - text: |
      It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are reputable, that are sort of like a chain, if I can use that word, still you have to deal with the people that, happen to be operating it locally 
  - text: |
      I don't subscribe to cable
  - text: |
      And felt that feeling of safety
  - text: |
      When you see all these horror stories on television about child care  
  - text: |
      It's just the way your attitude changes 
  - text: |
      As I said, I don't have kids  
  - text: |
      We are being cooperative,  
  - text: |
      But they seem to like it okay.
  - text: |
      it's low hills
  - text: |
      but adequate ones were really tough to find
  - text: |
      I just have to be honest about it  
  - text: |
      they say it's  like the sixth grade reading level
  - text: |
      they're pretty g
  - text: |
      I had a friend that said, before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
  - text: |
      he's got a job  there
  - text: |
      so I guess, that's an alternative  
  - text: |
       I have two sisters in Texas now, one in Austin, one in Dallas
  - text: |
      So I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned 
  - text: |
      because of the poor service and also because I give to the United Way
  - text: |
      I love traveling and being involved in that and finding out more
  - text: |
      of course there's still a lot of work to be done,  
  - text: |
      I've skied in Colorado
  - text: |
      I'm a news junkie
  - text: |
      Neil and Lehrer, they're pretty good too
  - text: |
      but, it's real hard to work in the summers and  holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband
  - text: |
       -- tied in a chair
  - text: |
      one of the ways that I get information is, every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing
  - text: |
      it's really neat
  - text: |
      I'm sort of in an antique business
  - text: |
      I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children 
  - text: |
      why am I waiting
  - text: |
      I do have a friend, she and her roommate became live-in care givers
  - text: |
      but that's if you don't watch it there, then you're going to hear somebody else's canned report, somebody else's view about it
  - text: |
      it's the one that's going downhill,
  - text: |
      I think about, wouldn't it be nice, 
  - text: |
      she got older 
  - text: |
      so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,  
  - text: |
      we were lucky when our children were that age, 
  - text: |
      Now we have one takes piano lessons
  - text: |
      I've been finding out that I really am a nice person
  - text: |
      and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news
  - text: |
      <Laughter>  That's like World War Three every minute <laughter>  
  - text: |
      I'm an only child 
  - text: |
      But the thing about the child care I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work 
  - text: |
      For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES, a couple of newspapers
  - text: |
      it's really different because  that's the chalk hills down there,
  - text: |
      so  I've never been around children  
  - text: |
      gosh
  - text: |
      but when you have them in, their little feet are moving 
  - text: |
      what do I know

      my best friend is one child of ten

      And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know, to someone else, it's just, I can imagine how emotional  it must be and multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person  or you're uncomfortable with the situation, as far as child care,

      I thought Austin was beautiful

      Copper is kind of my favorite up there.
  - text: |
      I really like NPR a lot
  - text: |
      it's just north of me here
  - text: |
      so it's difficult for them
  - text: |
      we also learned something from that experience as our children got older 
  - text: |
      and that's pretty fun.
  - text: |
      the other one, of course can't do the same thing
  - text: |
      I can hardly wait to get up there
  - text: |
      I heard Aspen got three feet
  - text: |
      There are those times when I think, gee,  if I didn't have children I could be out playing  (( bridge ))  or golf 
  - text: |
      I mean, that was a joke
  - text: |
      we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper
  - text: |
      That's just a difference in kids, I suppose 
  - text: |
      now, I need it
  - text: |
      but I swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes.
  - text: |
      so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school
  - text: |
      except for time in service
  - text: |
      I think that may be the key word 
  - text: |
       Oh, something
  - text: |
      It's not always worth it
  - text: |
      so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
  - text: |
      we are helping,  you know
  - text: |
      It really is 
  - text: |
      actually my hobbies mostly  is my sports. Tennis,

      but it's a little part time thing

      We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly, in Oregon

      By the time the youngest ones are there, you'll have older one to take care of them

      their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing

      I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby

      we moved away from institutionalized child care --
  - text: |
      It's that care givers are not omniscient -- 
  - text: |
      How unfortunate <laughter> 
  - text: |
      Much as other cultures disagree, our lives don't revolve around our children 
  - text: |
      going over that pass is  just a real nightmare
  - text: |
      but maybe some day they can get closer

      my wife and I were both only children 
  - text: |
      you don't know what happens after they get in school 
  - text: |
      at one point in time we've had au pairs,
  - text: |
      so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
  - text: |
      We're to get one to three inches tonight
  - text: |
      But I do hear my friends talk about it

      Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly, I'm sure 
  - text: |
      Had that invasion or whatever it is
  - text: |
       -- they are not all things to all people --
  - text: |
       but  you still have to be realistic, as well, I think 
  - text: |
      since they're both in school, you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them  <<Voices fading in and out>> 
  - text: |
      The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers 
  - text: |
      and  no  it's not adequate to sit and wait
  - text: |
      it stays low a lot <laughter>
  - text: |
      I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought, maybe 
  - text: |
      but that's not really providing you news. 
  - text: |
      That's kind of boring to me, I think

      Wonderful place.
  - text: |
      the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
  - text: |
      It takes that mixture of a very mature college student, who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time, and the interest to the children
  - text: |
       -- or all children 
  - text: |
      He's admissions director
  - text: |
      I love tennis too
  - text: |
      and  that's something that we're struggling with now 
  - text: |
      I substitute at the schools part-time
  - text: |
      we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends 
  - text: |
      Wrong 
  - text: |
      I guess those are the only places I've skied up there
  - text: |
      and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
  - text: |
      And then  you don't really know what happened 
  - text: |
