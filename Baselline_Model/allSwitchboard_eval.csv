utterance,intent
because you and I we have work schedules,inform_continue
we can be called at work  ,inform_continue
we have Social Security numbers,inform_continue
they can trace us down,inform_continue
we have telephones,inform_continue
then we have checkbooks,inform_continue
 Criminals have none of these things,inform_continue
They're real difficult to catch,inform_continue
and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas we write a check,inform_continue
us we,selfcorrection
Yeah,agreement
So where do you think they target their efforts? ,inform_pass
That's true,agreement
They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals,inform_pass
How would you go about changing it? ,setquestion
<Throat_clearing> You know,stalling
that's a,retraction
I've nailed the problem down  ,inform_continue
but I,inform_pass
<Laughter>,autopositive
<Laughter>,allopositive
Leave the details op to somebody else,completion
huh,checkquestion
Yeah,confirm
I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about,inform_continue
I think to begin with you would have,inform_continue
you would h  you would have,selfcorrection
like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical,inform_continue
yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets,inform_pass
Yeah,agreement
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from,inform_pass
you know uh,stalling
talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases,inform_continue
you know,stalling
do uh cause,selfcorrection
a uh a,stalling
It's kind of like do it in the similar vein like VCR or television repair,inform_continue
do it do it,stalling
similar like,selfcorrection
uh,stalling
If you take your TV in a lot of these TV repair places will say  well  I'll repair your TV for a hundred dollars,inform_continue
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it,inform_continue
He he,stalling
he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars,inform_continue
if he comes in and says  I'll repair your VCR or somebody else's VCR for a hundred dollars gets in there,inform_continue
your your,stalling
maybe it's a blown fuse,inform_continue
takes him two minutes,inform_continue
he fixes it,inform_continue
he still charges you that hundred dollars,inform_continue
maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that whether it's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case,inform_continue
you know,stalling
a  a civil somebody suing somebody else,selfcorrection
you know,stalling
uh,stalling
that's it.,inform_pass
None of this,inform_pass
I firmly believe in that  ,agreement
because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney,propositionalquestion
Oh,stalling
yeah,answer
And here's this bum that didn't have a job,inform_continue
Yeah,autopositive
and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford,inform_pass
That's true,agreement
Who's paying for that,setquestion
Yeah,agreement
y well you you know <laughter> ,stalling
you're talking to part of them that's paying for that <laughter>,answer
<Laughter>,autopositive
Yeah,agreement
and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it <laughter> ,inform_pass
<Laughter>,autopositive
That's right,agreement
You know,stalling
that's it it's,selfcorrection
its's it's,stalling
it's amazing,inform_continue
and and,stalling
when you stop and look at it the judges they're all former lawyers,inform_continue
I mean,stalling
th they're,stalling
Yeah,agreement
Well,stalling
that's another problem,inform_continue
I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it <laughter>,inform_pass
<Laughter>,autopositive
I mean they're they're,stalling
they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever,inform_continue
with that type person running it you could expect that you,inform_continue
I mean you you,stalling
